Version 1.56
------------
 * Added a new program called find_dither.c to the package.  This program
   takes a pair of input images and their SExtractor catalogs and calculates
   the dither (in pixels) between the images.  The program is intended to
   be useful for co-adding dithered frames obtained on the same night --
   right now there is no provision for any rotation between the images.

Version 1.55
------------
 * Updated version of get_params.c

Version 1.54
------------
 * Updated version of astrom_rot.c

Version 1.53
------------
 * Temporary version containing "in progress" versions of new xy_rot.c

Version 1.52
------------
 * For drawing compass, use rotation determined from CD matrix as default,
   if available.  If not, use the old method of determining image rotation
   from instrument-specific keywords.
 * Changed axis labeling to "Relative R.A."/"Relative Dec" if image PA
   is within 1 degree of PA=0.

Version 1.51
------------
 * Fixed a small bug in draw_compass in fitsim.c
